      Thank for your interest in this webpage, just a short story about me. I am a graduate of CS who is really in love with Programming. I am a very passionate about programming and I love to learn new things. Though things get challenging a times but my passion for programming keeps me going. I would realy like to be a guru in the tech world. My dream is to master as many progamming languages as possible, eg:
JAVA,PYTHON, C, C++, C#, JAVASCRIPT, HTML, CSS, SQL, JQUERY, REACT,PHP,HTML,CSS.<br>It will be my biggest achievement ever if I can master all of them.
